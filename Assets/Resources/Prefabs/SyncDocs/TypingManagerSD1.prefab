    Instructor: Scott Bowers

    Office: BAER 1192

    Hours: Monday, Wednesday, Friday 6 PM


    Course Description:

    This course is intended to teach students the basics of designing, implementing,
    testing, and debugging software programs. Students will be introduced to several
    game development platforms, working with the C# and Java programm'
  - Scott, is that you?
  - "Who is this? How\u2019d you get into this document?"
  - "It\u2019s Tina. Tina Knigh"
  - "Tina? What is this, what\u2019s going on?"
  - If you are really Tina, how can you prove it?
  - "What is this, some kind of game to you? Whoever you are, this isn\u2019t funny."
  - "Well it\u2019s kind of a long story"
  - "Remember how you got me a coffee after I fell asleep during one of your classes?
    You wrote on the cup, \u201C404: sleep not found\u201D"
  - "Well, that\u2019s oddly specific. If you\u2019re really Tina, where have you
    been these last couple months?"
  - "You\u2019re right, this isn\u2019t funny at all. Has anyone reported me missing?"
  - Tina Knigh is reported missing, yes.
  - Okay Scott, I need you to listen to me...
  - The week before school ended, I told you my parents and I were visiting my family
    in Shincho. Do you remember?
  - Vaguely, yes...
  - "Okay, I know you won\u2019t believe me but... they put me in this place that\u2019s
    like, a boot camp but also a hospital?"
  - "Wait, what? What\u2019re you talking about?"
  - "Look, I know it sounds crazy but my parents said I\u2019m addicted to video games.
    They took me to this place that treats addicts or something"
  - "So\u2026 like some sort of rehab?"
  - Sure, if rehab was a place where you get beaten and brainwashed. This place is
    a nightmare!
  - "This is a lot to wrap my mind around. I don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s
    going on..."
  - "If this is really Tina, we contacted your parents already. They haven\u2019t
    responded to us."
  - "If your parents really forced you into this center, shouldn\u2019t you have fought
    back?"
  - "Why haven\u2019t you replied to any of the emails we sent you?"
  - "I bet they\u2019re still here waiting for me to finish treatment\u2026"
  - "So, they\u2019re still in Shincho? That would explain a lot, actually."
  - "Even if you talked to them, they\u2019d deny everything and say I dropped out.
    But that\u2019s not true! I wouldn\u2019t do that!"
  - I wanted to! But I think my parents drugged me
  - "Your parents drugged you? That\u2019s a serious accusation, how do you know this?"
  - Because everything about that day is fuzzy... I ate breakfast, got in the car,
    and passed out. When I woke up, it was dark outside.
  - "That must\u2019ve been hours! You don\u2019t remember anything about the car
    ride?"
  - "Nothing. The last thing I remember is being dragged out by guys in military clothes.
    I wanted to run but my legs couldn\u2019t move."
  - "This place is super anti-electronics. They wanted to take my phone, but I said
    it was at home. Luckily, they didn\u2019t check my inner jacket pocket"
  - "So, if you had it on you, why didn\u2019t you contact anyone before?"
  - "My parents make me give them all my passwords... They can check anytime I try
    to message or email someone. But I know they\u2019d never think to check SyncDocs "
  - "Okay. Let\u2019s say that I believe that you\u2019re really Tina Knigh, and your
    parents put you in this hospital. Where is this place located?"
  - I have no idea
  - "What do you mean? You don\u2019t know where you are?"
  - "I was passed out when we drove here. And I can only speak Shinchanese, I can\u2019t
    read it. Whenever I ask someone what this place is called, they either laugh or
    hit me..."
  - That sounds awful...
  - "Scott, I need you to believe me\u2026 I need your help"
  - "Alright, I believe you. But how can I help? You\u2019re on the other side of
    the world!"
  - "Sorry\u2026 this is just a lot to wrap my mind around."
  - "This is just crazy. I don\u2019t know how you expected me to believe this, but
    whatever this is\u2026 I\u2019m not going to be involved."
  - "You\u2019re literally a lifesaver, thank you!!! I know being so far makes helping
    tough. But even looking people up online could help me"
  - "Trust me, I didn\u2019t know a place like this existed either. But you\u2019re
    the only one who can help me right now"
  - What do you need me to do?
  - "Please, Scott, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can last in here! I can\u2019t
    do this alone!"
  - If you really need help, then find someone else. But obviously, your parents sent
    you to this mental hospital for a reason. I suggest you open up to your treatment
    and work towards getting better.
  - If I die, my blood is on your hands. Will you be able to live with yourself when
    that happens?
  - "We\u2019re done here. Don\u2019t contact me ever again."
  - "I can\u2019t believe I trusted you\u2026 Good-bye, Scott"
  - "Everyone here goes by nicknames, so it\u2019s been hard to figure out who people
    are. Sometimes I see this guy walking around with a nametag that says \u201CKwan\u201D"
  - "That\u2019s not exactly a lot to go off of. Do you know anyone else?"
  - "Oh! I do know the names of two girls in my dorm: Rena Woo and Joy Aun. Let me
    know if you find anything out. I\u2019ll be waiting"
