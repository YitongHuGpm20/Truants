  - Please tell me that worked.
  - What the heck is this? What am I looking at?
  - "YES! I can\u2019t believe he left it in!"
  - What am I looking at, Tina??
  - "Oh nothing, you just connected to ALL the devices on the center\u2019s WiFi through
    my phone. That\u2019s all"
  - "Are you telling me that all of these numbers and coordinates I'm seeing... are
    phones connected to the center\u2019s internet?"
  - "Well that\u2019s if they\u2019re moving around. Otherwise, it\u2019s probably
    a printer or something."
  - "I feel like I\u2019m gonna be sick..."
  - "Scott, I can\u2019t do this alone. I need someone to tell me where the guards
    are and where I should go. Please, don\u2019t bail on me now..."
  - "Guess there\u2019s no point in looking back now. I can make something visually
    with this information, maybe a map or something. But I need at least a day to
    do it."
  - "I\u2019m ready to leave ASAP. Do you think you could get it done before 4 AM
    my time tomorrow?"
  - I will certainly try my best.
  - Okay. I need to go. People are starting to wake up. That number I gave you is
    my phone number. I'll call you at exactly 4 AM my time.
  - "Tina, these people are not fooling around. I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help
    you get out, but if you get caught\u2026 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen
    to you."
  - I don't plan on getting caught. Not with you helping me. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
    And Scott? Thanks again for being there for me.
