  - SCOTT! Are you there?? Please answer me!!!
  - "I\u2019m here, Tina! What\u2019s going on??"
  - "I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I get scared thinking that you\u2019ll delete this document
    because you think I\u2019m crazy. I don\u2019t want to be alone again"
  - "Relax, Tina. I\u2019m not gonna do that. In fact, I think I found out where you\u2019re
    at: Langxing Teenager Behavior Modification Center, in Langxing City."
  - Behavior modification center? What the hell, so they ARE trying to brainwash us!
  - "Like you said before, they treat kids who are addicted to electronics. But from
    what I\u2019ve read, it sounds like there might be things going on there that
    go beyond treatment."
  - You have no idea... what kind of things did you read about this place?
  - "It seems like they\u2019re very serious about physical education."
  - They mentioned some sort of agricultural program.
  - Education and rehabilitation were two things they referred to repeatedly.
  - "Omg THAT is an understatement\u2026 they make us run and do push-ups until we
    puke. And if we fall behind they hit us with sticks"
  - I think I remember reading former soldiers were part of the staff there.
  - "They make us dress in camo clothes and march every day. I have no idea what they\u2019re
    saying, but they smack you with sticks if you don\u2019t do everything right..."
  - These people sound like monsters...
  - "Oh you mean the part of the day where they make us do hard labor in the fields?
    Yeah that\u2019s my favorite"
  - Hard labor?
  - "Digging holes, picking up big rocks, hauling wheelbarrows of cow shit\u2026 apparently
    it\u2019s teaching us discipline. My back hurts every day"
  - Do they at least have decent health services? They mentioned that, too.
  - "Does writing phrases like \u201Chard work and discipline are key\u201D and \u201Cthe
    parent is always right\u201D on a chalkboard for hours count as education?"
  - "I\u2019d have to say no, it doesn\u2019t."
  - "Then I\u2019m learning nothing. Not that my teachers care, they hate that I can\u2019t
    read the language. They either ignore me or slap me with rulers"
  - "Wow\u2026 what about rehabilitation? Is that some sort of psychological treatment?"
  - "Oh, don\u2019t get me started on health care here. All they do is give us pills
    to take multiple times a day. I don't even know what they are"
  - You have no idea? Have you been taking these pills?
  - "Sometimes they forget to check if I swallow them. But I\u2019ve had to make myself
    throw up a couple times"
  - "That\u2019s probably for the best."
  - "But the thing I hate most about this place...  is when they take kids in for
    \u201Cspecial treatment\u201D"
  - "What do you mean by \u201Cspecial treatment\u201D?"
  - "\u201DSpecial treatment\u201D? You make it sound like they\u2019re experimenting
    on children or something. I don\u2019t know if I believe that..."
  - "I don\u2019t even know what to say. The way you describe things in there\u2026
    It sounds like a nightmare."
  - "I don\u2019t know actually. I just hear them crying when they\u2019re dragged
    away, and the screams that come from the consultation rooms\u2026"
  - "Oh my God, those poor kids\u2026"
  - "Sometimes they take us at night. What if I\u2019m next? I have to get out of
    here!"
  - "Can\u2019t say for sure if they go that far. But I had a friend who was taken
    in for special treatment yesterday. I haven\u2019t seen her since\u2026"
  - Is that normal? What usually happens to the kids who are taken?
  - "They usually come out, all shaky and quiet. I waited for her to come to lunch
    but\u2026 she\u2019s gone, Scott. And I will be too, if I don\u2019t get out of
    here!"
  - "A nightmare that I can\u2019t seem to wake up from. Scott you have to get me
    out of here\u2026"
  - "I\u2019m working on that. Remember that staff member you told me about, Kwan?
    Well, I got his full name. Turns out he does IT work for the center."
  - "Do you think you could get him to give you a floor plan or something? I need
    to know where I\u2019m going when I escape"
  - "I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll be that easy. I\u2019ll need to figure out a
    way to convince him to work with me"
  - "He works for a boot camp where kids get tortured. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s hiding
    some secrets you can hold against him somewhere"
  - Are you suggesting that I blackmail him?
  - "I\u2019m suggesting that you do whatever it takes to get that floor plan from
    him. I can\u2019t stand being here any longer, please\u2026"
  - "Okay, okay. I\u2019ll see what I can do. Hang in there, Tina."
  - "I\u2019ll try, but please hurry"
