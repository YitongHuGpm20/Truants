  typingContent:
  - Hey can I get an update? Did you talk to Kwan?
  - "Hey, Tina. Yeah, I got in contact with him. He\u2019s willing to comply with
    helping us."
  - "That\u2019s amazing Scott, thank you! Finally some good news"
  - "Well, hold on. It doesn\u2019t seem like he can help much."
  - Did you tell him we need a map of the center?
  - "I did. He said he couldn\u2019t get us a map, even if he wanted to. He doesn't
    have the clearance to access their files."
  - Well there has to be something he can do!
  - "I don\u2019t know what to say, Tina. He said we\u2019d basically have to hack
    the center\u2019s database to get it, and that\u2019s not something he can do."
  - I might know a guy.
  - What do you mean?
  - "I know someone who can help us\u2026 help YOU hack into one of the center\u2019s
    computers."
  - Are you serious? You know someone who can hack their computers?
  - "No, I\u2019m sorry but\u2026 this has gone too far."
  - "Well, I guess we\u2019ve gotten this far right? Might as well give this guy a
    shot."
  - "There\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me Scott\u2026 But I have no choice
    now. He might be our only hope at this point"
  - Who even is this guy?
  - "NO! Scott please, you can\u2019t bail on me now!"
  - "Tina, this is just too crazy! You\u2019re telling me to commit a crime against
    some sort of crazy center in another country. Even if my job, my life, wasn\u2019t
    on the line here, how do you expect me to persuade a person to do something like
    that?"
  - "Because I might DIE in here if he doesn\u2019t help me. And he\u2019ll help me
    if he knows that.\r\nWhat about you Scott? Are you gonna let me die here?\r"
  - "Alright, alright... you\u2019ve made your point. Just tell me who I need to talk
    to."
  - "Thank you Scott. You\u2019re really a good person\u2026 I knew I could rely on
    you."
  - "I\u2019d hope that anyone would be willing to do the same, in my position. So,
    who am I contacting?"
  - "I don\u2019t suppose you remember Alex Perry\u2026 do you?"
  - "Please tell me you\u2019re not serious."
  - "He\u2019s the only one who can help."
  - "Tina, he hijacked our servers and forced our department to clean the enormous
    mess he made. Do you know what they\u2019ll do to me if they find out I talked
    to him?"
  - "They\u2019ll fire you. This is a huge risk for you too, I get that. I wouldn\u2019t
    be asking you to do this if it wasn\u2019t a matter of life or death."
  - "I mean, what do I even tell this guy to convince him to help us? It\u2019s not
    like I\u2019m telling him who I am. And aren\u2019t hackers usually private, paranoid
    people?"
  - 'Naw he''s chill. He answers almost anyone on Visager. I think he''ll help you
    if you just say this:

    "Knightmare needs your help, nachash."'
  - "That\u2019s it? That\u2019s all I have to say?"
  - "Mention the \u201Cprototype\u201D too. Tell him you need it."
  - "Okay. I\u2019ll try finding him on Visage."
  - "Scott, I\u2019m sorry for putting you through this. You don\u2019t know what
    this means to me\u2026 Thank you so much."
  - "Don\u2019t worry about it. Just stay safe for the time being."
  - "Okay. I\u2019ll be waiting."
