  - Any luck contacting Alex?
  - "I still can\u2019t believe it, but it actually worked\u2026 What the heck is
    this software, anyway?"
  - "I call it xPloit. Long story short, it lets you access a computer\u2019s files
    and download them"
  - "So, were you\u2026 was this software involved in the incident last quarter?"
  - I just want to point out once again how completely ILLEGAL this is.
  - Sounds useful. How does it work?
  - "I know what you\u2019re thinking. What he did last spring\u2026 I had nothing
    to do with it."
  - "I believe you. But this software\u2026 is it safe? Will they be able to trace
    me?"
  - "I know he fixed most of the bugs. But just to be safe, don\u2019t try to put
    the wrong password in too many times. That could be bad"
  - "Oh great\u2026 Wait, passwords? How does this thing even work?"
  - "You don\u2019t have to keep pointing that out, you know"
  - "But seriously, why do you even have this software? What\u2019s your connection
    with him?"
  - "Look, he was a mod on my gaming streams alright? He didn\u2019t like all these
    pervy guys spamming my chat, so\u2026 he made xPloit to get back at them"
  - "Obviously, it wasn\u2019t the only way he used it... But I digress, just tell
    me how it works."
  - "I mean I could give you a full explanation but I don\u2019t think we have time"
  - "I don\u2019t need to know everything. But what am I looking for?"
  - "So all you need to access a computer with xPloit is that person\u2019s IP address."
  - "A program with that much power and usability\u2026 Do you realize how dangerous
    this thing is, in the wrong hands?"
  - "It\u2019s not as simple as you think\u2026 You can\u2019t just log into a computer
    and download its files. They\u2019re protected by hashed passwords."
  - Hashed passwords? Like, scrambling a password with an algorithm? Those are virtually
    impossible to decipher!
  - "Not if you have the algorithm. Computers have a registry file that holds the
    password. You\u2019d never be able to figure what it really is on your own. But
    xPloit has a command that produces algorithms that are most likely to help you
    figure it out."
  - "Wait, so this tool doesn\u2019t tell you what the password to the computer is\u2026
    but it creates a key that can help you unlock it?"
  - Exactly!
  - "I don\u2019t even know what to say. That\u2019s incredible, but also terrifying."
  - "You can download the computer\u2019s files when you have its password. That\u2019s
    it. But if you want xPloit to work, you need to get Kwan to give you an IP address
    first."
  - "Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll get one from him."
  - "Please hurry Scott. I don\u2019t have much time left tonight."
